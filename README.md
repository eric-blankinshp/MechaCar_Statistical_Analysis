# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

# Overview

AutosRUS is reviewing statistical data points of the manufacturing process to find opportunities for higher consistency. Analysts have been tasked to review data points gathered from prototype vehicles to determine predictable MPG. We also need to provide summary statistics for suspension coil manufacturing in whole and by individual manufacturing locations. Then propose a study to futher compare MechaCar against competitive manufacturers.

# Linear Regression to Predict

This multi-linear regression is run on 6 data points. It shows that vehicle length and ground clearance have the most significant effect on MPG. Vehicle weight has a minor effect, as well. The slope is not zero, and the p-values are low, so we must reject the null-hypthesis. The relattionships between the variables and MPG is more than chance. With a r-squared result of better than 71%, this model will provide accurate predictions.

# Summary Statistics on Suspension Coil PSI

When reviewed as a whole, variance is within 100 psi, as set by company policy.
