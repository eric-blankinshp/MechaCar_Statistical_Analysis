AutosRUS is reviewing statistical data points of the manufacturing process to find opportunities for higher consistency.

We also need to provide summary statistics for suspension coil manufacturing in whole and by individual manufacturing locations. Then propose a study to futher compare MechaCar against competitive manufacturers.
